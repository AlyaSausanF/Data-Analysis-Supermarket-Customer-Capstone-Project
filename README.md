Shopping preferences (web, store, catalog).
Project Workflow
  1. Data Cleaning
     - Removed missing and duplicate entries.
     - Reformatted data types for consistency.
     - Ensured accurate column headers and values for analysis.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Investigated shopping preference distributions (web, catalog, store).
     - Identified patterns in customer demographics:
     - Generational segments (Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials).
     - Educational levels, marital status, and income distributions.
     - Analyzed shopping behavior metrics (recency, complaints, discount usage).
  3. Insights and Visualization
     - Demographic Insights:
     - Gen X dominates both store and web preferences.
     - Customers with graduation-level education are most prevalent.
     - Customers with below-median income favor both store and web equally.
     - Behavioral Insights:
     - Customers exhibit similar recency and complaint rates regardless of shopping preferences.
     - Discounts and promotional campaigns are equally effective across web and store customers.
  4. Conclusion and Recommendations
     - Identified 237 customers with similar characteristics across web and store preferences.
     - Proposed targeted campaigns to convert store customers to web shopping.
     - The estimated campaign acceptance rate of ~25.96%, potentially converting 61 customers.
